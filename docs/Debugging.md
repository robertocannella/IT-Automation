## System Tools

Some tools to help find the root cause
* `strace <file_name>`:   Calls that the programs running on our computer make to the kernel

    ```
        strace -o <output_file> <executable_file>
        strace <executable_file> | less
    ```
    In the simplest case strace runs the specified command until it exits.  It intercepts and records the system calls which arecalled by a process and the signals which are received by a process.  The name of each system call, its arguments and its return value are printed on standard error or to the filespecified with the -o option.
