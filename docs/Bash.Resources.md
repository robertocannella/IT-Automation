## Utility

`wc <file_name>`: counts the amount of characters, words, and lines in the given file; can also count the same values of whatever it receives via stdin

`file <file_name>`: prints the type of the given file, as recognized by the operating system

`sort <file_name>`: sorts the lines of the file alphabetically

`cut -d[separator] -f[fields] <file_name>`: for each line in the given file, splits the line according to the given separator and prints the given fields (starting from 1)
**useful when parsing log files*

**Glob**: The glob module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned in arbitrary order. Akin to taking advantage of star [*] in BASH.
