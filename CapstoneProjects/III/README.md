# Capstone Project Three

## Automatically Generate a PDF and send it by Email

*Introduction*

You work for a company that sells second hand cars. Management wants to get a summary of the amounts of vehicles that have been sold at the end of every month. The company already has a web service which serves sales data at the end of every month but management wants an email to be sent out with an attached PDF so that data is more easily readable.

What you'll do
* Write a script that summarizes and processes sales data into different categories
* Generate a PDF using Python
* Automatically send a PDF by email

Modules

* `reportlab`

## Optional challenge

As optional challenges, you could try some of the following functionalities:

Sort the list of cars in the PDF by total sales.

Create a pie chart for the total sales of each car made.

Create a bar chart showing total sales for the top 10 best selling vehicles using the ReportLab Diagra library. Put the vehicle name on the X-axis and total revenue (remember, price * total sales!) along the Y-axis.
